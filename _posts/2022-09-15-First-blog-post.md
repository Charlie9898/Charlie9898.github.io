What do you think being a data scientist is about?  

Is should be manipulating with data. A data scientist should be responsible for the complete cycle from data collection, data analysis, and reaching analysis results. Data scientists should also understand the questions about data and solve the questions about data using mathematical skills.

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  

The major duties are in the data life cycle, including data collection, analysis, and conclusions. The key knowledge should be mathematics, statistics, and computer programming.

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  

Data scientists are about understanding questions and solving problems with data. It is problem oriented.
Statisticians are about using mathematical and statistical models to analyze data.
They might have some common knowledge and approaches to solve problems, but their focus differs.

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

Statistics for me is a tool to solve my domain-knowledge problems, so I believe I should obtain some more knowledge in the area of data science.
