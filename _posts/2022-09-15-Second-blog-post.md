You've just completed your first project for the course - hooray!  Write a blog post reflecting on your project (what was the purpose of the project, what did you learn, what you would do differently, etc.).  You should upload your final document from project 1 and link to it as well.  

The purpose of the project is to develop our own R functions to compile several datasets. It is a overall summary of the materials learned during the first few weeks of the class.
During the project, I learned how to write new functions, call functions, make simple plots, and combine different datasets.
For the future study, I would write and test each of the function in a separate script before compiling all the code to Rmarkdown.
