**For your blog post, write up a brief discussion of how you would plan to determine variables to use in a regression model.  What variable selection techniques do you prefer and why?**

Interpretation of the models and variables are my first priority. So for variable selection, I would personally pick all possible variables to fit the initial model first. Then apply some statistical approaches to eliminate useless ones. For example, I may exclude variables that are not significant. For variable selection, I would prefer shrinkage method such as ridge or Lasso since the penalty terms serve as a factor to balance the variance-bias tradeoff. Lasso can be more desired since it can shrinkage some variables to 0 and return a more parsimonious model. However, it is always important to check some performance measures such as model R-square value, test MSE, etc.
